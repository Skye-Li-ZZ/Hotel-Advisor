# Hotel-Advisor

I was planning a trip with my friend for the winter vacation and viewing hotel reviews on Tripadvisor. After spending a whole night reading thousands of reviews to locate a “decent” room, we were so exhausted, and even felt sad about hoteliers who might have to read tons of these comments every now and then to find out how good their hotel is in the market. Then suddenly, a thought flashed in my mind, “why can’t we just let the computer read these views and tell us how good the hotel is?”

So, if I were managing a hotel, what would I want to know? Well, as a person who’s fascinated about numbers, I ‘d love a score that informs me how good guests think my place is in a most straight-forward way. After that, I would want to find out why they like or hate my hotel through key words from their compliments or complains. Also, it would be great if I could know which part to improve, from hardware to services, that might make my hotel more attractive.

That’s how I ended up on this project of predicting how good a hotel is using sentiment analysis and machine learning tools. There are 2 main purposes of this analysis:

    >Help hoteliers know why guests love or hate their hotel and service without spending a long time reading each individual comment.

    >Predict if your hotel is a competitive candidate in the market, and know what to improve.
